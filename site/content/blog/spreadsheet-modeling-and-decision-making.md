What is good spreadsheet design?  What are the best practices of building financial models? How to present the results of your work with impact? 

In this Spreadsheet Modeling and Decision Making blog series, we’ll explore what makes a good spreadsheet model, how to build proper financial model, how to effectively communicate value to your collaborators, and **how to make better decisions, faster.**

If you are an experienced decision maker, or a power user building complex spreadsheet models, you might already know the answers. If you are also looking for a way to increase your and your team’s efficiency then read further as we will also review ways to **automate various parts of what constitutes number-driven decision making.**

## How to Connect Numbers with Decisions?

With [financial models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_modeling), mathematical representations of financial situations, that will assist you in gauging the future performance of a business and making better, informed decisions.

Business drivers may vary from industry to industry, but they all share the same goal - enable you and your audience to make confident decisions based on the numbers and reports your financial model produces.

Financial models come in different shapes - from income statements and balance sheets to forecasting and advanced risk analysis models.

**All financial models have one goal, which is to answer the ultimate question** that constantly arises in different forms: ‘Does it make sense to do this? Is this profitable? What are the risks? Are there more advantages than disadvantages? What will be the impact of these decisions or those external factors?’

A well-made financial model that is driven by reasonable assumptions will improve your decision making. A poorly-built model or invalid assumptions are unreliable and will produce inaccurate results, which will hamper your decision making.

## Building Financial Models: What Makes a Good Spreadsheet Model?

A model is as good as the mind structuring it and the assumptions you put in. 

**The old principle of  ‘garbage in - garbage out’ applies to models as well.**

Do not start typing and building the model before you have thought about the following:

* **Your audience** - what is the objective of the financial model? Who will use it? For what? Although there is a great degree of similarity between different models, each industry and company function (strategy, marketing, etc.) use specific lexicon or ways of calculating important KPIs.
* **The structure** - do you need multiple worksheets? Does it make sense to have a dedicated worksheet for inputs, calculations and output? Three key aspects you should always keep in mind is the ease of understanding, extracting useful information and maintaining the model for all stakeholders. 
* **The granularity** - where should the level of detail stop? What output will drive your recommendations or decisions? While it is desirable to include as many details as possible to improve the precision of projections and outcomes, it is easy to get caught up tinkering with insignificant metrics. Stop at the right tradeoff (for you and your audience) between assumption flexibility and complexity. Your goal is to strike a balance between granularity (for scalability) and readability (for maintainability and auditing). You have to minimise the chances that you or your stakeholders introduce accidental errors that are difficult to detect.

## Financial Modeling Basics

Generally, a financial model can be broken down into three parts:

* **Input sheets** where stakeholders add assumptions and values to be processed by your financial model. This can be done either manually or by importing data from external sources such as ERP systems. 
* **Calculation sheets** where you set the calculations up.
* **Results sheets** where stakeholders can see a series of data and charts relevant to their decisions. 

**The first version of the model you build will become the foundation of your future work** and will determine how easy or hard it will be to maintain, so devote your utmost attention to it. The payoff of ensuring good spreadsheet design will be worth it if it's done properly.

## Errors in Spreadsheets Are Your Worst Enemies

After the model has been built, you need to audit and debug it to make sure all the data and calculations are correct and produce accurate results. 

This is an important step in building financial models as **mistakes can be difficult to detect, and errors can be costly.** According to MarketWatch, [88% of spreadsheets contain errors](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/88-of-spreadsheets-have-errors-2013-04-17). Your goal is to be in the other 12%.

**Best practice is to test the financial model on historical data.** To automate this process, you can use such means as data validation but make sure to not trust it blindly. 

We will review tools and techniques for spreadsheet auditing and debugging in the upcoming blog posts.

## Updates to Models Should Not Create New Errors

Model maintenance and updating is an ongoing process and can be as simple as updating a single value or adjusting dozens of formulae based on new requirements.

This may sometimes feel tedious but do not let your guard down as **the main purpose of an update is to improve the quality of the model, not to break it.** [JPMorgan learned this the hard way](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-jpmorgan-risk/analysis-jpmorgan-to-be-haunted-by-change-in-risk-model-idUSBRE84H15120120518) after losing billions of dollars due to changes in its value-at-risk model.

If you are a single person who does the update, it is rather straightforward - you go in, make changes and test them. If you are using Excel, create a copy of the initial model and remember to have understandable naming convention and version control.

If there are multiple people working on the update then it becomes much more complicated as Excel was not built as a scalable collaboration tool. You will have to either manually control every contributor and keep track of their changes or rely on software solutions that can help you document inputs and assumptions and manage versions.
