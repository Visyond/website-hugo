      Visyond offers **a secure way to collaborate without data leaks and focus
      only on what is important:**


      * No more cumbersome back and forth emails and versions to reconcile

      * Limit what parts of the spreadsheet people can interact with, down to a
      single cell

      * Securely store spreadsheet data; multiple assumptions, scenarios,
      conversations and attachments directly in the relevant cells

      * Keep track of inputs, changes and versions with always up-to-date
      automatic reports and interactive presentation

      * Gather assumptions and enable others to test them  through simple
      interfaces,  without changing (and risking to break) the spreadsheet
