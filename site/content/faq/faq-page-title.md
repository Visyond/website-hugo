              You never lose information. Multiple assumptions can coexist in
              the same cell. The last added value does not overwrite the
              existing ones. Nobody, including the project owner, can modify
              data entered by others.
          - answer: >-
              You decide who sees and interacts with specific worksheets and
              dashboards. Share only specific worksheets, reports and dashboards
              with specific people for better control over information flow and
              data privacy.
          - answer: >-
              You connect decision makers, consultants, analysts, modelers, and
              other stakeholders together in a single secure environment. Out of
              the box, every member of the team has access to automated tools
              that help them do their job faster, while minimizing the risk of
              accidental errors.
          - answer: >-
              You are in full control of all the steps of your workflow. From
              spreadsheet modeling and auditing, data gathering, forecasting and
              scenario planning, to the presentation of interactive dashboards,
              financial statements and reports. All this happens in one place,
              creating a single source of truth, in the same environment where
              you carry out calculations.

          - answer: >-
              You know what’s happening in your projects. Multiple collaborators
              can work on the same project, and Visyond will track and report
              all assumptions created by multiple collaborators, attachments,
              and conversations.
          - answer: >-
              You easily manage scenarios. Create and compare scenarios
              on-the-fly with just a few clicks during meetings or
              presentations, and quickly identify which business drivers change
              between scenarios.
          - answer: >-
              You have a bird’s-eye view of your spreadsheets. At a glance you
              will be able to see all scenarios and assumptions that drive your
              spreadsheets, analyses and dashboards created by different
              collaborators, errors and their root causes, conversations and
              attachments.
        faqSectionSubTitle: Visyond is built for data tracking and to provide real-time insights
      - answersList:
          - answer: >-
              You visualize model structure, detect errors and potential data
              inconsistencies in real time, and easily understand formulas
              thanks to the option to use natural language (e.g., Revenues[2021]
              = Revenues[2020](1 + growth[2021) vs B3 = B2( 1 + A3) ).
          - answer: >-
              You save countless hours of tracking errors in the spreadsheet.
              Instantly identify errors, their propagation chain and root cause,
              and navigate precedent and dependent cells.

      - answersList:
          - answer: >-
              You analyze formula-driven data on the fly. Automate and carry out
              impact analyses and stress-tests that skilled professionals
              prepare in hours or days, in minutes and without long error-prone
              manual setups.
          - answer: >-
              You analyze data in the same place where you carry out
              calculations and create visualizations. Visyond combines models
              and their outputs directly with analyses, allowing for flexible,
              on-the-fly analysis.
          - answer: >-
              You operate with real-time data. You don’t have to waste time on
              data preparation or risk to introduce errors while transferring
              data between modeling software and visualization or reporting
              tools. All changes in the models are immediately reflected in the
              analyses that you run and in the interactive dashboards you
              distribute to stakeholders.

              You remove bottlenecks. Empower collaborators to contribute their
              own analyses in self-service mode, without depending on modelers
              and analysts.
          - answer: >-
              You don’t overwrite other people’s work. Collaborators that
              contribute their analyses will not overwrite each other’s work so
              you can safely collaborate without fear of losing important
              information.

              Visyond and BI Tools are not directly comparable: they are two
              different types of applications with different focus. Visyond has
              general BI Functionalities. BI Tools cannot do what Visyond does.

      - answersList:
          - answer: >-
              Models and visualizations use the same data source. Dashboards and
              calculators are connected directly to your spreadsheet models
              without additional data preparation, processing and migrations.
          - answer: >-
              Not only backward-looking. Build forward-looking projections and
              forecasts based not only on raw data but also on formulas from
              your spreadsheet models.

              Interact with models indirectly through an always up-to-date
              presentation layer. Create interactive, spreadsheet-driven
              calculators and dashboards, and share with each stakeholder only
              what they need to see or interact with.
          - answer: >-
              Empower collaborators to test assumptions independently and
              self-serve on ‘what-if’ questions, while shielding them from
              sensitive or unnecessary information.

          - answer: >-
              Visyond wasn’t built to be used as a ‘data dump’ for millions of
              data rows. Instead, we focus on formula-based calculations. You
              can filter large data sets outside of Visyond and then feed it
              with aggregated data that you need for calculations.

              Visyond is a collaboration-first platform that combines
              spreadsheets, automated analysis and spreadsheet-driven
              visualizations into a streamlined, integrated workflow.

              Visyond is very easy to use – it looks and feels like a general
              spreadsheet. Keep your work habits & leverage Excel skills in a
              familiar environment.
        faqSectionSubTitle: Minimal learning curve

              We have built an extensive knowledge base that explains how to use
              Visyond should you have any trouble. ‘Training mode’ in the
              application will walk you through the features and workflows on
              the module’s page.

  - faqSectionContent:

          - answer: >-
              We support Excel syntax and formulas so you can import most Excel
              files or create a project directly in Visyond using the same skill
              set you need to create an Excel file. You can also export to
              Excel.
          - answer: >-
              You may have to tweak something on import as you would do when
              importing from Excel to Google for example, but if your models are
              not using cutting edge functionalities (that even Excel online
              would not support), you would be good to go.

              It runs in the browser and its performance should be compared to
              Excel 365, Google Sheets and other online tools. Install the
              latest version of your browser for the best user experience (we
              recommend Google Chrome). Also, close unneeded applications, tabs
              and browser windows to free up memory.
