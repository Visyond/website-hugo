              <strong>You never lose information.</strong> Multiple assumptions
              can coexist in the same cell. The last added value does not
              overwrite the existing ones. Nobody, including the project owner,
              can modify data entered by others.
          - answer: >-
              <strong>You decide who sees and interacts with specific worksheets
              and dashboards.</strong> Share only specific worksheets, reports
              and dashboards with specific people for better control over
              information flow and data privacy.
          - answer: >-
              <strong>You connect decision makers, consultants, analysts,
              modelers, and other stakeholders together in a single secure
              environment.</strong> Out of the box, every member of the team has
              access to automated tools that help them do their job faster,
              while minimizing the risk of accidental errors.
          - answer: >-
              <strong>You are in full control of all the steps of your
              workflow.</strong> From spreadsheet modeling and auditing, data
              gathering, forecasting and scenario planning, to the presentation
              of interactive dashboards, financial statements and reports. All
              this happens in one place, creating a single source of truth, in
              the same environment where you carry out calculations.

              <strong>You know what’s happening in your projects.</strong>
              Multiple collaborators can work on the same project, and Visyond
              will track and report all assumptions created by multiple
              collaborators, attachments, and conversations.
          - answer: >-
              <strong>You easily manage scenarios.</strong> Create and compare
              scenarios on-the-fly with just a few clicks during meetings or
              presentations, and quickly identify which business drivers change
              between scenarios.
          - answer: >-
              <strong>You have a bird’s-eye view of your spreadsheets.</strong>
              At a glance you will be able to see all scenarios and assumptions
              that drive your spreadsheets, analyses and dashboards created by
              different collaborators, errors and their root causes,
              conversations and attachments.

      - answersList:
          - answer: >-
              <strong>You visualize model structure,</strong> detect errors and
              potential data inconsistencies in real time, and easily understand
              formulas thanks to the option to use natural language (e.g.,
              Revenues[2021] = Revenues[2020] * (1 + growth[2021) vs B3 = B2 * (
              1 + A3) ).
          - answer: >-
              <strong>You save countless hours of tracking errors in the
              spreadsheet.</strong> Instantly identify errors, their propagation
              chain and root cause, and navigate precedent and dependent cells.

          - answer: >-
              <strong>You analyze formula-driven data on the fly.</strong>
              Automate and carry out impact analyses and stress-tests that
              skilled professionals prepare in hours or days, in minutes and
              without long error-prone manual setups.
          - answer: >-
              <strong>You analyze data in the same place where you carry out
              calculations and create visualizations.</strong> Visyond combines
              models and their outputs directly with analyses, allowing for
              flexible, on-the-fly analysis.
          - answer: >-
              <strong>You operate with real-time data.</strong> You don’t have
              to waste time on data preparation or risk to introduce errors
              while transferring data between modeling software and
              visualization or reporting tools. All changes in the models are
              immediately reflected in the analyses that you run and in the
              interactive dashboards you distribute to stakeholders.

              <strong>You remove bottlenecks.</strong> Empower collaborators to
              contribute their own analyses in self-service mode, without
              depending on modelers and analysts.
          - answer: >-
              <strong>You don’t overwrite other people’s work.</strong>
              Collaborators that contribute their analyses will not overwrite
              each other’s work so you can safely collaborate without fear of
              losing important information.

              <strong>Visyond and BI Tools are not directly comparable:</strong>
              they are two different types of applications with different focus.
              Visyond has general BI Functionalities. BI Tools cannot do what
              Visyond does.

          - answer: >-
              <strong>Models and visualizations use the same data
              source.</strong> Dashboards and calculators are connected directly
              to your spreadsheet models without additional data preparation,
              processing and migrations.
          - answer: >-
              <strong>Not only backward-looking.</strong> Build forward-looking
              projections and forecasts based not only on raw data but also on
              formulas from your spreadsheet models.

              <strong>Interact with models indirectly through an always
              up-to-date presentation layer.</strong> Create interactive,
              spreadsheet-driven calculators and dashboards, and share with each
              stakeholder only what they need to see or interact with.
          - answer: >-
              <strong>Empower collaborators to test assumptions
              independently</strong> and self-serve on ‘what-if’ questions,
              while shielding them from sensitive or unnecessary information.

              <strong>Visyond wasn’t built to be used as a ‘data dump’</strong>
              for millions of data rows. Instead, we focus on formula-based
              calculations. You can filter large data sets outside of Visyond
              and then feed it with aggregated data that you need for
              calculations.

              <strong>Visyond is a collaboration-first platform</strong> that
              combines spreadsheets, automated analysis and spreadsheet-driven

              <strong>Visyond is very easy to use</strong> – it looks and feels

              <strong>We support Excel syntax and formulas so you can import
              most Excel files</strong> or create a project directly in Visyond
              using the same skill set you need to create an Excel file. You can
              also export to Excel.
          - answer: >-
              You may have to tweak something on import as you would do when
              importing from Excel to Google for example, but if your models are
              not using cutting edge functionalities (that even Excel online
              would not support), you would be good to go.

              Visyond can integrate with Excel and reference an Excel file as an
              ‘external source’ inside a Visyond project (for example, to
              display a value from an Excel cell in a Visyond cell). We are open
              to discuss custom integrations for your specific needs, as we’ve
              found out that ‘one size fits all’ integrations don’t really cut
              it for something as varied as spreadsheet models and many
              different systems people use in conjunction with them.

              We have an open API that allows you to interact with Visyond
              projects externally (i.e. adding external sources, managing access
              permissions and collaborators, etc.) but not internally (i.e.
              querying the contents of a project). Please tell us more about how
              you want to use an API.

              It runs in the browser and its performance should be compared to
              Excel 365, Google Sheets and other online tools. Install the
              latest version of your browser for the best user experience (we
              recommend Google Chrome). Also, close unneeded applications, tabs
