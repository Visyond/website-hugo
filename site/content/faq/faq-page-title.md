          - answer: >-
              <strong>You never lose information.</strong> Multiple assumptions
              can coexist in the same cell. The last added value does not
              overwrite the existing ones. Nobody, including the project owner,
              can modify data entered by others.
          - answer: >-
              <strong>You easily manage scenarios.</strong> Create and compare
              scenarios on-the-fly with just a few clicks during meetings or
              presentations, and quickly identify which business drivers change
              between scenarios.
          - answer: >-
              <strong>You decide who sees and interacts with specific worksheets
              and dashboards.</strong> Share only specific worksheets, reports
              and dashboards with specific people for better control over
              information flow and data privacy.
          - answer: >-
              <strong>You connect decision makers, consultants, analysts,
              modelers, and other stakeholders together in a single secure
              environment.</strong> Out of the box, every member of the team has
              access to automated tools that help them do their job faster,
              while minimizing the risk of accidental errors.

              <strong>You know what’s happening in your projects.</strong>
              Multiple collaborators can work on the same project, and Visyond
              will track and report all assumptions created by multiple
              collaborators, attachments, and conversations.
          - answer: >-
              <strong>You have a bird’s-eye view of your spreadsheets.</strong>
              At a glance you will be able to see all scenarios and assumptions
              that drive your spreadsheets, analyses and dashboards created by
              different collaborators, errors and their root causes,
              conversations and attachments.
          - answer: >-
              <strong>You are in full control of all the steps of your
              workflow.</strong> From spreadsheet modeling and auditing, data
              gathering, forecasting and scenario planning, to the presentation
              of interactive dashboards, financial statements and reports. All
              this happens in one place, creating a single source of truth, in
              the same environment where you carry out calculations.

      - answersList:
          - answer: >-
              <strong>You visualize model structure,</strong> detect errors and
              potential data inconsistencies in real time, and easily understand
              formulas thanks to the option to use natural language (e.g.,
              Revenues[2021] = Revenues[2020] * (1 + growth[2021) vs B3 = B2 * (
              1 + A3) ).
          - answer: >-
              <strong>You save countless hours of tracking errors in the
              spreadsheet.</strong> Instantly identify errors, their propagation
              chain and root cause, and navigate precedent and dependent cells.

    faqSectionTitle: How is Visyond different from a general purpose spreadsheet?
  - faqSectionContent:
      - answersList:
          - answer: >-
              <strong>You analyze formula-driven data on the fly.</strong>
              Automate and carry out, in minutes, analyses and stress-tests that
              used hours or days to set up.
          - answer: >-
              <strong>You analyze data in the same place where you carry out
              calculations and create visualizations.</strong> Visyond connects
              spreadsheets and their outputs directly to collaborative, flexible
              and automated analysis tools. Each collaborator can run their own
              set of analyses on-the-fly, without overwriting or changing
              others’ work. Visyond then connects the outputs of analyses to
              interactive, spreadsheet-driven dashboards, allowing collaborators
              to view the outcome of your analyses and/or interact with the
              spreadsheet without actually touching or seeing the spreadsheet.
          - answer: >-
              <strong>You operate with real-time data.</strong> You don’t have
              to waste time on data preparation or risk to introduce errors
              while transferring data between modeling software and
              visualization or reporting tools. All changes in the models are
              immediately reflected in the analyses that you run and in the
              interactive dashboards you distribute to stakeholders.

          - answer: >-
              <strong>You remove bottlenecks.</strong> Empower collaborators to
              contribute their own analyses in self-service mode, without
              depending on modelers and analysts.
          - answer: >-
              <strong>You don’t overwrite other people’s work.</strong>
              Collaborators that contribute their analyses will not overwrite
              each other’s work so you can safely collaborate without fear of
              losing important information.

              <strong>Visyond and BI Tools are not directly comparable:</strong>
              they are two different types of applications with different focus.
              Visyond has general BI functionalities. BI Tools alone cannot do
              what Visyond does.
        faqSectionSubTitle: Visyond and BI Tools are not directly comparable
      - answersList:
          - answer: >-
              <strong>Models and visualizations use the same data
              source.</strong> Dashboards and calculators are connected directly
              to your spreadsheets without additional data preparation,
              processing and migrations.
          - answer: >-
              <strong>Not only backward-looking.</strong> Build forward-looking
              projections and forecasts based not only on raw data but also on
              formulas from your spreadsheet models.

              <strong>Interact with spreadsheets through a secure, always
              up-to-date presentation layer.</strong> Create interactive,
              spreadsheet-driven calculators and dashboards, and share with each
              stakeholder only what they need to see or interact with. With
              dashboard’s controls (sliders, drop-downs, etc.) connected
              directly to the spreadsheet cells, you can let collaborators query
              the spreadsheet and get the outputs without seeing or modifying
              the spreadsheet. You can allow collaborators to apply certain
              scenarios from you spreadsheet to the dashboard they see.
          - answer: >-
              <strong>Empower collaborators to test assumptions
              independently</strong> and self-serve on ‘what-if’ questions,
              while shielding them from sensitive or unnecessary information.

              <strong> Like any other spreadsheet, Visyond is not a Big Data
              platform.</strong>. Instead, we focus on formula-based
              calculations. If you want to operate on more than 10,000 rows,
              1,000 columns or 128 worksheets, then Visyond might not be what
              you are looking for. However, you can use totals/aggregated data
              as assumptions to drive your predictive model.

              <strong>Visyond is a collaboration-first platform</strong> that

              <strong>We support Excel syntax and formulas so you can import
              most Excel files</strong> or create a project directly in Visyond
              using the same skill set you need to create an Excel file. You can
              also export to Excel.
          - answer: >-
              You may have to tweak something on import as you would do when
              importing from Excel to Google for example, but if your models are
              not using cutting edge functionalities (that even Excel online
              would not support), you would be good to go.

              We have an open API that allows you to interact with Visyond
              projects externally (i.e. adding external sources, managing access
              permissions and collaborators, etc.) but not internally (i.e.
              querying the contents of a project). Please tell us more about how
              you want to use an API.

          - answer: >-
              Visyond can integrate with Excel and reference an Excel file as an
              ‘external source’ inside a Visyond project (for example, to
              display a value from an Excel cell in a Visyond cell). We are open
              to discuss custom integrations for your specific needs, as we’ve
              found out that ‘one size fits all’ integrations don’t really cut
              it for something as varied as spreadsheet models and many
              different systems people use in conjunction with them.
