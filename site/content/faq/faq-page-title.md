              You never lose information. Multiple assumptions can coexist in
              the same cell. The last added value does not overwrite the
              existing ones. Nobody, including the project owner, can modify
              data entered by others.
          - answer: >-
              You decide who sees and interacts with specific worksheets and
              dashboards. Share only specific worksheets, reports and dashboards
              with specific people for better control over information flow and
              data privacy.
          - answer: >-
              You connect decision makers, consultants, analysts, modelers, and
              other stakeholders together in a single secure environment. Out of
              the box, every member of the team has access to automated tools
              that help them do their job faster, while minimizing the risk of
              accidental errors.
          - answer: >-
              You are in full control of all the steps of your workflow. From
              spreadsheet modeling and auditing, data gathering, forecasting and
              scenario planning, to the presentation of interactive dashboards,
              financial statements and reports. All this happens in one place,
              creating a single source of truth, in the same environment where
              you carry out calculations.

          - answer: >-
              You know what’s happening in your projects. Multiple collaborators
              can work on the same project, and Visyond will track and report
              all assumptions created by multiple collaborators, attachments,
              and conversations.
          - answer: >-
              You easily manage scenarios. Create and compare scenarios
              on-the-fly with just a few clicks during meetings or
              presentations, and quickly identify which business drivers change
              between scenarios.
          - answer: >-
              You have a bird’s-eye view of your spreadsheets. At a glance you
              will be able to see all scenarios and assumptions that drive your
              spreadsheets, analyses and dashboards created by different
              collaborators, errors and their root causes, conversations and
              attachments.

              You analyze formula-driven data on the fly. Automate and carry out
              impact analyses and stress-tests that skilled professionals
              prepare in hours or days, in minutes and without long error-prone
              manual setups.
          - answer: >-
              You analyze data in the same place where you carry out
              calculations and create visualizations. Visyond combines models
              and their outputs directly with analyses, allowing for flexible,
              on-the-fly analysis.
          - answer: >-
              You operate with real-time data. You don’t have to waste time on
              data preparation or risk to introduce errors while transferring
              data between modeling software and visualization or reporting
              tools. All changes in the models are immediately reflected in the
              analyses that you run and in the interactive dashboards you
              distribute to stakeholders.
