          - answer: >-
              **Visyond ensures the integrity of data.** Nobody, including the project owner, can modify data entered by others. You have a bird’s-eye view of your projects that shows you assumptions, scenarios, analyses and dashboards created by collaborators.

      - answersList:
          - answer: >-
              **No staging.** You don’t need to do any data preparation just to get it into the dashboards. Dashboards, charts, and analyses use a single data source - your spreadsheet.
          - answer: >-
              **Real-time updates.** Dashboards always stay up-to-date by getting the latest changes from your spreadsheet.
          - answer: >-
              **No additional integrations.** You don’t need to set up and maintain integrations to move your data to dashboards.
          - answer: >-
              **No coding.** You don’t need to write a single line of code to create an interactive dashboard from your spreadsheet.
        faqSectionSubTitle: Dashboards get data directly from your spreadsheet
      - answersList:
          - answer: >-
              **Your spreadsheets are safe.** Dashboard controls (sliders, drop-downs, etc.) are connected directly to the spreadsheet cells, and you can let collaborators query the spreadsheet and get the outputs (in the form of charts and/or value) without seeing or modifying the spreadsheet.

              **You can allow collaborators to apply certain scenarios from your spreadsheet** to the dashboard they see. They can extend it, creating their own ‘what-if’ view, without modifying the original scenario.
        faqSectionSubTitle: Collaborators can answer ‘what-if’ questions on their own
      - answersList:
          - answer: >-

      - answersList:
          - answer: >-
              Collaborators can **contribute their own analyses in self-service mode**, without depending on modelers and analysts. They will not overwrite each other’s work, and you can safely collaborate without losing data.
