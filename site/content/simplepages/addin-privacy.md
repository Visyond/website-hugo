## **ADD-INS FOR EXCEL FOR WINDOWS AND MAC, EXCEL ONLINE**

With modern (JavaScript-based) Excel add-in from Visyond, you can automate scenario, sensitivity and risk analysis in your Excel workbook. You can also present and share interactive dashboards containing cells and charts in your Excel workbook. Visyond add-in works with Excel Online in Office 365, Excel on iPad, or in desktop Excel for Windows or Macintosh (collectively, "modern Excel"). 

This section of our Privacy Policy will help you understand the privacy implications of automation, dashboarding and change tracking leveraging the cloud (whether Visyond’s or on-premise).

## **HOW MODERN ADD-INS WORK**
Your Excel workbook is opened from disk, and solved using your PC's own resources (processor and memory). Neither Microsoft nor Visyond sees your Excel workbook.

When you use Visyond’s add-in, some data processing is carried out by Visyond, operating as a "cloud service”.

For this to happen, it's necessary to transfer some cell values in your local Excel workbook, over the Internet to our server or your company’s server if you choose an Enterprise package with on-premise option.  

## **PROTECTING YOUR PRIVACY AND INFORMATION SECURITY**

When you open the add-in in a new workbook, you will be asked if you want to link the workbook to a Visyond project. If you accept, the elements of the workbook necessary to carry out analytics, visualizations and change tracking will be transferred to the server, using a limited-lifetime, secure access token.
The actual transfer of only the Excel workbook contents that is needed for Visyond to operate, between online storage and your browser, and between the online storage and our Server, is encrypted using the industry standard Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol.
