## About the Nomination

When looking for innovation that sits outside of financial modelling's very comfy home of Excel, the Out of Excel category of the [**Financial Modelling Innovation Awards 2020**](https://www.financialmodellingawards.com/) is looking for ideas that **genuinely expand the profession of financial modelling** and have made the very best of not being restrained by Excel's many and lovingly endured limitations.

Showing just how financial modelling is evolving, there were a number of worthy entries to consider within this category, which included some great examples that are truly enhancing financial modelling.

The winner of this category has sought to move the spreadsheet experience to the cloud and make scenario modelling a genuinely collaborative experience; the cloud-based single-source-of-the-truth model with the advanced functionality of Excel.

**And the winner of the Out of Excel Category is Visyond!**

## Problem

Decision making requires modelling, scenario planning, forecasting, analytics, knowledge management, data visualization and reporting tools. Analysts, experts, clients, CxOs must collaborate with strict requirements on data security and governance. 

Without Visyond, the process requires multiple platforms and causes the following problems:

* Data leaks & security threats
* Version chaos and lack of a single source of truth
* Difficulty to track changes and compare scenarios
* Time- consuming and error-prone manual setups, with high probability of accidental errors
* Lack of interactivity and self-service options for what-if analysis/stress testing

## Solution

Visyond runs in the browser, it’s a single source of truth, and its cells allow for multiple assumptions to be combined into scenarios in real time. They can contain attachments and conversations to improve the quality of the data and the communication process.

Comparing scenarios, running Monte Carlo simulations or knowing what are the most impactful cells on a certain formula cell, becomes fast and automated.

Anyone can carry out, in minutes, what takes experts hours or days to do. Stakeholders can self-serve through interactive online slides, and run their what-ifs from the cells that the project owner decides to expose on these dashboards.

Finally, Visyond uses human-readable names and detects the root cause of errors.
