## Visyond is built for secure collaboration and knowledge management

**You never lose information.** Multiple assumptions can coexist in the same cell. The last added value does not overwrite the existing ones. Nobody, including the project owner, can modify data entered by others.

**You decide who sees and interacts with specific worksheets and dashboards.** Share only specific worksheets, reports and dashboards with specific people for better control over information flow and data privacy.

**You connect decision makers, consultants, analysts, modelers, and other stakeholders together in a single secure environment.** Out of the box, every member of the team has access to automated tools that help them do their job faster, while minimizing the risk of accidental errors.

**You are in full control of all the steps of your workflow.** From spreadsheet modeling and auditing, data gathering, forecasting and scenario planning, to the presentation of interactive dashboards, financial statements and reports. All this happens in one place, creating a single source of truth, in the same environment where you carry out calculations.

## Visyond is built for data tracking and to provide real-time insights

**You know what’s happening in your projects.** Multiple collaborators can work on the same project, and Visyond will track and report all assumptions created by multiple collaborators, attachments, and conversations.

**You easily manage scenarios.** Create and compare scenarios on-the-fly with just a few clicks during meetings or presentations, and quickly identify which business drivers change between scenarios.

**You have a bird’s-eye view of your spreadsheets.** At a glance you will be able to see all scenarios and assumptions that drive your spreadsheets, analyses and dashboards created by different collaborators, errors and their root causes, conversations and attachments.

## Visyond is built for reducing the risk of accidental errors

**You visualize model structure**, detect errors and potential data inconsistencies in real time, and easily understand formulas thanks to the option to use natural language (e.g., `Revenues[2021]  = Revenues[2020]`_`(1 + growth[2021) vs  B3 = B2`_`( 1 + A3)` ).

**You save countless hours of tracking errors in the spreadsheet.** Instantly identify errors, their propagation chain and root cause, and navigate precedent and dependent cells.

# How is Visyond different from analytics tools?

## Visyond is built for automation, flexibility and convenience

**You analyze formula-driven data on the fly.** Automate and carry out impact analyses and stress-tests that skilled professionals prepare in hours or days, in minutes and without long error-prone manual setups.

**You analyze data in the same place where you carry out calculations and create visualizations.** Visyond combines models and their outputs directly with analyses, allowing for flexible, on-the-fly analysis.

**You operate with real-time data.** You don’t have to waste time on data preparation or risk to introduce errors while transferring data between modeling software and visualization or reporting tools. All changes in the models are immediately reflected in the analyses that you run and in the interactive dashboards you distribute to stakeholders.

## Visyond is built for self-service collaborative analysis and decision making

**You remove bottlenecks.** Empower collaborators to contribute their own analyses in self-service mode, without depending on modelers and analysts.

**You don’t overwrite other people’s work.** Collaborators that contribute their analyses will not overwrite each other’s work so you can safely collaborate without fear of losing important information.

# How is Visyond different from BI / data visualization tools?

> ‘Visyond has greatly improved my productivity by reducing time spent on spreadsheet analysis, presentations and updates by more than 80%. This allowed me to focus on business impact rather than the intricacies of modeling I had to deal with in Excel’ 
>
> \- [Ericsson’s Chief Modeler](https://visyond.com/casestudy/ericsson-case-study-visyond/)

**Visyond and BI Tools are not directly comparable:** they are two different types of applications with different focus. Visyond has general BI Functionalities. BI Tools cannot do what Visyond does.

## Visyond is built for real-time data updates

**Models and visualizations use the same data source.** Dashboards and calculators are connected directly to your spreadsheet models without additional data preparation, processing and migrations.

**Not only backward-looking.** Build forward-looking projections and forecasts based not only on raw data but also on formulas from your spreadsheet models.

## Visyond is built for self-service and interactivity

**Interact with models indirectly through an always up-to-date presentation layer.** Create interactive, spreadsheet-driven calculators and dashboards, and share with each stakeholder only what they need to see or interact with.

**Empower collaborators to test assumptions independently** and self-serve on ‘what-if’ questions, while shielding them from sensitive or unnecessary information.

# What Visyond is not?

**Visyond is not ‘Big Data’** and wasn’t built to be used as a ‘data dump’ for millions of data rows. Instead, we focus on formula-based calculations. You can filter large data sets outside of Visyond and then feed it with aggregated data that you need for calculations.

**Visyond is not a standalone visualization tool.** Visyond is a collaboration-first platform that combines spreadsheets, automated analysis and spreadsheet-driven visualizations into a streamlined, integrated workflow.

# How easy it is to start using Visyond?

> ‘It is very user-friendly and easy to use’

**Minimal learning curve.** Visyond is very easy to use  – it looks and feels like a general spreadsheet. Keep your work habits & leverage Excel skills in a familiar environment.

**Step-by-step guides.** We have built an extensive knowledge base that explains how to use Visyond should you have any trouble. ‘Training mode’ in the application will walk you through the features and workflows on the module’s page.

**Accessible anywhere.** Visyond does not require installations or complex setups – it works in the browser.

# Can I work on my Excel projects?

**Yes, Visyond is Excel-compatible.** We support Excel syntax and formulas so you can import most Excel files or create a project directly in Visyond using the same skill set you need to create an Excel file. You can also export to Excel.

You may have to tweak something on import as you would do when importing from Excel to Google for example, but if your models are not using cutting edge functionalities (that even Excel online would not support), you would be good to go.

# How fast is Visyond?

**Visyond is as fast as online leading platforms can be.** It runs in the browser and its performance should be compared to Excel 365, Google Sheets and other online tools.
Install the latest version of your browser for the best user experience (we recommend Google Chrome). Also, close unneeded applications, tabs and browser windows to free up memory.

# Is Visyond secure?

**Yes.** We use industry-standard best practices to store data.

# How much does Visyond cost?

[Please see our pricing page.](https://visyond.com/pricing/)
