whyVisyondSectionHeader: Why Visyond for Scenario Planning?
whyVisyondText: "* Visyond transforms scenario planning into a truly collaborative experience by removing the need to use multiple tools and transfer data between them.\r\n* Modelers, analysts, decision makers and clients can securely collaborate and have accessible and easy-to-use automation tools in a single, cloud-based decision-making platform with the spreadsheet model at the center, without version chaos and risks of losing information or overwriting data.\r\n* Scenario planning insights can be communicated through interactive dashboards that are managed in a single place, and seen only by specific stakeholders, without the need to update static slides at every assumption change.\r\n* Stakeholders can stress-test the assumptions in a safe environment where they are the only one seeing the output driven by their changes and where they cannot accidentally break the underlying model.\r\n"
