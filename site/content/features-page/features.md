          Visyond offers a single place to store all your spreadsheet data -
          assumptions, supporting documentation, conversations and approvals.
          Forget about back & forth emails with bits of information, multiple
          versions of the spreadsheet flying around and critical data lost along
          the way.

          Visyond allows you to communicate more efficiently while avoiding data
          leaks. It removes the need for emailing spreadsheets, back-and-forth
          copy-paste between PowerPoint and Excel or any other visualization
          tools.

          You no longer need to create multiple spreadsheet templates, manually
          distribute it among stakeholders risking accidental layout and formula
          changes and spending long hours auditing the spreadsheets once you’ve
          received them back with data.

          Visyond’s Interactive Slides are an elegant way to present data from
          your spreadsheets - information is always up to date, as each slide
          automatically syncs data with your spreadsheet. Interactive elements
          such as input fields and charts allow stakeholders to test their own
          assumptions through a safe and simple user interface.

          presentations, you can create interactive calculators/apps, such as
          ROI calculators, and securely share them with stakeholders without
          exposing the spreadsheet - you decide what they can see or interact
          with!

          even if the chart is in Visyond’s Interactive Presentations.
