          Unlike other spreadsheets, multiple assumptions can coexist in a cell
          as opposed to last value overwriting the existing one. Nobody,
          including the project owner, can modify data entered by others.
          Multiple collaborators can work on the same project, and Visyond will
          track and report who added assumptions, when and why.
