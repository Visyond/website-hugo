      Visyond drastically increases modelers’ performance and provides a safety
      net that helps in auditing the spreadsheet and avoiding accidental
      mistakes. Automated debugging solutions such as Error Root Cause and Cell
      Dependencies Analysis will also save you countless hours that would be
      otherwise spent on tiresome manual error-hunting.

          When in Audit Mode, Visyond offers simple and intuitive ways to track
          errors and their root cause.

          It highlights error and circular cells clearly; The trendlines help
          you visually identify unexpected behaviors; The Precedents Panel
          displays on top the precedent cells that are error - this way you can
          identify the root cause of the error propagation chain with a few
          clicks.

          Dependency analysis gives you a bird’s eye view of your model in the
          same way Google Maps does of a neighborhood. It’s a powerful auditing
          tool, uncovering errors that would be otherwise painstaking to catch.

      Selective Sharing will not only protect your data but also help you
      improve communications with decision makers by allowing them to see only
      parts of the model / presentations that they are interested in, without
      overwhelming them with non-relevant information and calculations.

      Our built-in analysis tools automate typical routine tasks (like [scenario
      comparison](/features/scenarios/) or [identification of the most important
      model drivers](/features/tornado/)) that would otherwise require add-ons
      or writing macros. With Visyond, you can focus on getting valuable
      insights from your data instead of error-prone lengthy manual setups.

          Sometimes models get too complex. With Visyond you can simplify them
          by identifying variables with no significant impact on the output and
          how they interact with one another.

      Answer ‘what-if’ questions in real time without going back to the
      spreadsheet or the modeler. Visyond’s Interactive Slides is an elegant way
      to visualize different scenarios - assumptions can be tested directly in
      the presentations without exposing or changing the spreadsheet’s content
      or structure. With Visyond, you no longer need to maintain separate
      presentation layers on top of the spreadsheet.
