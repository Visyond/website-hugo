      Visyond drastically increases modelers’ performance and provides a safety
      net that helps in auditing the spreadsheet and avoiding accidental
      mistakes. Automated debugging solutions such as Error Root Cause and Cell
      Dependencies Analysis will also save you countless hours that would be
      otherwise spent on tiresome manual error-hunting.
    title: Streamline Modeling Tasks
  - descr: "You do not need to worry about juggling multiple versions of the spreadsheet while tracking inputs from multiple stakeholders through various communication channels. \r\n\r\nVisyond solves data chaos and establishes a single source of truth by providing intuitive interface to manage scenarios and store all inputs, attachments and conversations directly in the relevant cells.\r\n"

      Visyond’s Selective Sharing and granular permissions control will ensure
      that sensitive information will be kept safe and only stakeholders you
      approve will have access to it.
    title: Protect Sensitive Information And Avoid Data Leaks
  - descr: >-
      Selective Sharing will not only protect your data but also help you
      improve communications with decision makers by allowing them to see only
      parts of the model / presentations that they are interested in, without
      overwhelming them with non-relevant information and calculations.
    title: Share Only Relevant Data
  - descr: >-
      Our built-in analysis tools automate typical routine tasks (like scenario
      comparison or identification of the most important model drivers) that
      would otherwise require add-ons or writing macros. With Visyond, you can
      focus on getting valuable insights from your data instead of error-prone
      lengthy manual setups.
    title: Perform Analysis in Minutes Instead of Days
  - descr: >-
      Answer ‘what-if’ questions in real time without going back to the
      spreadsheet or the modeler. Visyond’s Interactive Slides is an elegant way
      to visualize different scenarios - assumptions can be tested directly in
      the presentations without exposing or changing the spreadsheet’s content
      or structure. With Visyond, you no longer need to maintain separate
      presentation layers on top of the spreadsheet.
