      Visyond makes data gathering & consolidation easier by helping you avoid
      common issues that arise when collecting inputs. You no longer need to
      create multiple spreadsheet templates, manually distribute it among
      stakeholders risking accidental layout and formula changes and spending
      long hours auditing the spreadsheets once you’ve received them back with
      data.
