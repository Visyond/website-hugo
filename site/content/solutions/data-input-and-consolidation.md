topTitle: Eliminate the Hassles During Data Gathering
topSubTitle: >-
  When a month or a quarter ends it is a never-ending hassle gathering and
  consolidating data across departments and stakeholders. New spreadsheet
  templates, hopefully error-free,  are created and passed around to gather the
  numbers. This often wastes time, and requires added work to verify and check
  the accuracy of data. During the process the reasons behind each modified
  number often loses its visibility – causing further inquiries. This all makes
  closing your books ceaseless nightmare.

      Visyond makes the data gathering process efficient allowing you to cut
      days worth of effort down to minutes. It eliminates the need for all the
      manual processes that are inherent with spreadsheets. 


      Finance, as the document owner, maintains complete control and visibility
      over the entire data gathering process. This eradicates rework and manual
      auditing due to manually handling and linking spreadsheets. It literally
      slashes the time it takes to complete the work!
