topTitle: Eliminate the Hassles During Data Gathering and Consolidation
topSubTitle: >-
  When a month or a quarter ends or you need to gather assumptions from experts,
  it is a never-ending hassle gathering and consolidating data across
  departments and stakeholders. New spreadsheet templates, hopefully
  error-free,  are created and passed around to gather the numbers. This often
  wastes time, and requires added work to verify and check the accuracy of data.
  During the process the reasons behind each modified number often loses its
  visibility – causing further inquiries. This all makes the workflow a
  ceaseless nightmare.
