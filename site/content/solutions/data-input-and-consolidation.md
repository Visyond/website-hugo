topTitle: Eliminate the Hassles During Data Gathering
topSubTitle: >-
  Every month-end or end of quarter it’s a never-ending hassle gathering and
  consolidating financial information across departments. Finance develops new
  spreadsheet templates – hopefully error-free! And then they begin to pass
  spreadsheets among departments to gather the numbers. This often wastes time,
  and requires added work to verify and recheck the data’s accuracy. And during
  the process the reasons behind each modified number often loses its visibility
  – causing further inquiries. This all makes closing your books ceaseless
  nightmare.
