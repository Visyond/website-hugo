      - text: >-    
          You don’t need to move data across many tools - analyses are in the cloud together with the model, its scenarios and dashboards.
      - text: >-
          Both novices and experts can easily analyze data, and build powerful workflows that are difficult and expensive to set up otherwise.
      - text: >-
          No-code and no need for maintenance if the spreadsheet changes.

      Create interactive ‘what-if’ dashboards to visualize scenarios and forecasts, powered by your model’s calculations, without exposing the intricacies of the spreadsheet.
    benefitsList:
      - text: >-
          Viewers playing with the numbers on the dashboard can’t break the spreadsheet (or even see it, if you so wish).
      - text: >-
          Each stakeholder has a unique view depending on which worksheets and dashboards they are allowed to see.
      - text: >-
          Dashboards are secure and always up-to-date visualization layers on top of your spreadsheet, which acts as a calculation engine in the cloud (a single source of truth).

          Hide the complexity of the spreadsheet behind easy-to-use interactive dashboards, exposing only relevant inputs collaborators can ‘play’ with.
      - text: >-
          Creating a dashboard is easy. Add output cells with decision metrics from your spreadsheet, select input cells, style them as sliders or dropdowns, throw in some charts, and your dashboard is ready to go!
      - text: >-
          Your spreadsheet is safe. Changing data on the dashboard does not change the spreadsheet.
