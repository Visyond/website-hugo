      Simulation analysis is a powerful forecasting tool applicable to almost
      every field - from Finance and Sales to Engineering:


      * Generate descriptive statistics, probability density function and
      cumulative distribution function

      * Manage uncertainty and risk and make forecasts quickly

      * Easily identify what probability distribution is more appropriate for
      your data
