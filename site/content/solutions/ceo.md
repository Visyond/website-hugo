      No back-and-forth emails. **No data chaos.** Work together on
      spreadsheets, communicate and attach relevant documentation directly in
      Visyond, control versions and **enjoy secure_ selective sharing_** - allow
      access to only certain cells, worksheets, or linked reports and slides and
      **expose only what each person has to see or interact with**!

    title: Collaborate and selectively share to different stakeholders
  - descr: >-
      Empower collaborators and decision makers to **answer any questions
      on-the-fly** and **compare scenarios easily**, without calling consultants
      or “model gurus”. Visyond removes bottlenecks and everybody will get
      valuable insights in a few clicks instead of days or weeks. Findings and
      automatic visualizations can be exported to _interactive dashboards and
      apps_, and shared only with those who needs to see them.

      spreadsheet calculation engine without writing a line of code. **Let
      everybody you authorize “play” with the assumptions you selectively make
      available to them**: no risk of exposing sensitive information,
      accidentally corrupting data or showing unnecessary details.
