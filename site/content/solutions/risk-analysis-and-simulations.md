  self-service interactive dashboards.
WhyVisyondHeader: Why Visyond for Risk Analysis?
WhyVisyondText: >-
  * Visyond transforms Risk Analysis and Monte Carlo Simulations into a truly
  collaborative experience by removing the need to use multiple tools and
  transfer data between them.

  * Modelers, analysts, decision makers and clients can securely collaborate and
  have accessible and easy-to-use automation tools in a single, cloud-based
  decision-making platform with the spreadsheet model at the center, without
  version chaos and risks of losing information or overwriting data.

  * Performance risks can be communicated through interactive dashboards that
  are managed in a single place, and seen only by specific stakeholders, without
  the need to update static slides at every assumption change.

  * Stakeholders can stress-test the assumptions in a safe environment where
  they are the only one seeing the output driven by their changes and where they
  cannot accidentally break the underlying model.
