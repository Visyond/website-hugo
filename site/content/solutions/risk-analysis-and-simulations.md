WhyVisyondHeader: Why Visyond?
WhyVisyondText: >-
  * Visyond transforms Risk Analysis and Monte Carlo Simulations into a truly
  collaborative experience by removing the need to use multiple tools and
  transfer data between them.

  * Modelers, analysts, decision makers and clients can securely collaborate and
  have accessible and easy-to-use automation tools in a single, cloud-based
  decision-making platform with your spreadsheet model at the center, without
  version chaos and risks of losing information or overwriting data.

  * Customers can communicate the performance risk through interactive
  dashboards that are managed in a single place, and seen only by specific
  stakeholders, without the need to update static slides at every assumption
  change.

  * Stakeholders can stress-test the assumptions in a safe environment where
  they are the only one seeing the output driven by their changes and where they
  cannot accidentally break the underlying model.
