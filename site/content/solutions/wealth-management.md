  Wealth managers are limited by the data provided by the fund managers. They
  use an average performance instead of simulation on specific fund allocation.

  <br><br>

  Without Visyond, they cannot easily create multiple scenarios varying the
  expected return and allocation of funds, and open up self-service dashboards
  for clients to test assumptions on their own.
