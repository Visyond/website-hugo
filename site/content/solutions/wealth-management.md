WhyVisyondText: "Wealth managers are limited by the data provided by the fund managers. They use an average performance instead of simulation on specific fund allocation.\r<br><br>\nWithout Visyond, they cannot easily create multiple scenarios varying the expected return and allocation of funds, and open up self-service dashboards for clients to test assumptions on their own.\r\n"
