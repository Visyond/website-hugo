      In seconds, Visyond lets you automate typical routine tasks and test
      assumptions safely:

      * Graphically compare scenarios and answer ‘what-if’ questions in real
      time with Visyond’s Scenario & Waterfall Analysis

      * Compare relative importance of cells with instant Tornado Analysis

      * Understand the relationships between input and output cells with instant
      Sensitivity Analysis

      * Run simulations on your data with instant Monte Carlo analysis
    title: Analyze On-The-Fly
  - descr: >-
      You can always find the origins of data with Visyond - it offers a single
      source of truth for your spreadsheets - all assumptions, inputs and
      approvals, conversations and attachments are stored directly in the
      cells. 
    title: Always Know Where The Data Comes From
  - descr: "Since Visyond is cloud-based (or on-premise) - you never lose information. All inputs and changes are documented, giving you a full audit trail that is kept forever. You can always go back to previous versions of the spreadsheet or revert any changes individually, without rolling back the entire document.\r\n"
    title: Never Lose Your Data
  - descr: >-
      Mistakes can be costly - this is why it is imperative to ensure that the
      source model is robust and calculations are correct. With Visyond you can
      quickly identify the root causes of errors, explore cell dependencies and
      audit the spreadsheet in Audit Mode.
    title: Avoid Costly Mistakes
  - descr: "Some errors are introduced from outside. Somebody accidentally breaks a formula or make unwanted change… With Visyond’ selective sharing you can fine-tune permissions and manage access to your spreadsheets, down to a single cell.\r\n"
    title: Reduce Errors
  - descr: >-
      Using point-and-click interface select input and output cells from your
      spreadsheet to appear on the slide, add corresponding charts - and you are
      set! Now you can see the numbers and charts automatically update as you
      change the numbers directly in the presentation or calculator without
      changing anything in the source spreadsheet.

      The process took 1 stressful week and I did not feel comfortable to update

      clicks to update data.
