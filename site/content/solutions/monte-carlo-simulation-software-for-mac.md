          Visyond will generate descriptive statistics, probability density and cumulative distribution functions.      
      - text: >-
          Visyond supports Various continuous and discrete probability distributions. If you aren’t sure what distribution to use, Visyond can analyze your historical data and suggest options.

          Hide the complexity of the spreadsheet behind easy-to-use interactive dashboards, exposing only relevant inputs collaborators can ‘play’ with.
      - text: >-
          Creating a dashboard is easy. Add output cells with decision metrics from your spreadsheet, select input cells, style them as sliders or dropdowns, throw in some charts, and your dashboard is ready to go!
      - text: >-
          Your spreadsheet is safe. Changing data on the dashboard does not change the spreadsheet.
      - text: >-
          Control access. Share only specific dashboards and scenarios with specific collaborators.
    descr: >-
      Create interactive dashboards powered by your spreadsheet, and securely share them online. Let your team or clients safely play with the numbers and reflect on scenarios without the risk of breaking the spreadsheet.
