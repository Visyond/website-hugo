      Visyond drastically increases modelers’ performance and provides a safety
      net that helps in auditing the spreadsheet and avoiding accidental
      mistakes. Automated debugging solutions such as Error Root Cause and Cell
      Dependencies Analysis will also save you countless hours that would be
      otherwise spent on tiresome manual error-hunting.

    title: Streamline Financial Modeling & Reduce Risk of Errors
  - descr: >-
      Visyond makes data gathering & consolidation easier by helping you avoid
      common issues that arise when collecting inputs. You no longer need to
      create multiple spreadsheet templates, manually distribute it among
      stakeholders risking accidental layout and formula changes and spending
      long hours auditing the spreadsheets once you’ve received them back with
      data.

    title: Automate Data Gathering
  - descr: >-
      You can share the whole project, certain worksheets or only specific parts
      of a worksheet, whole presentations or specific slides without exposing
      any other data, conversations, attachments or calculations. With this,
      data gathering and consolidation is much faster, safer and less prone to
      errors, unwanted changes and accidental data leakages.
