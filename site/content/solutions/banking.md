  As a banking professional, you might often face these key challenges: ad-hoc
  model preparation & auditing requires inadequate time, lack of tracking &
  control over data changes and inputs, manual stress-testing and workflows, and
  having supporting information scattered around in endless threads of
  back-and-forth emails.

          You can share only specific cells you want stakeholders to contribute
          data to by simply selecting the cells and inviting collaborators to
          edit them.
