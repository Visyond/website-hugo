      With Visyond’s Tornado Analysis you can answer difficult questions,
      easily; “by what percentage does the output changes when the drives, on by
      one, change by x%?” -- **perform these calculations without coding or
      downloading add-ons**. 


      Tornado analysis will tell you **how much a selected output is sensitive
      to fixed changes in driver cells**.

      Significantly **streamline and simplify Sensitivity Analysis setup in
      minutes**. Sensitivity analysis will help you **understand clearly the
      nature of the relationship between input and output** variables in your
      spreadsheet or model. 


      This allows you to **identify to what degree variables impacts the
      outcome**, how different indicators interact & affect each other, and
      uncover errors in your models.

      update in real time with the related data and charts without affecting the
      underlying calculations or overriding any data**. 


      The dashboards and slides can be securely shared with other people without
      exposing raw data.
