    title: Analyze On-The-Fly
  - descr: >-
      Visyond offers a single place to store all your spreadsheet data -
      assumptions, supporting documentation, conversations and approvals. Forget
      about back & forth emails with bits of information, multiple versions of
      the spreadsheet flying around and critical data lost along the way. 


      You can manage and transfer team knowledge easily and stop being called
      all the time just to make minor changes.
    files:
      - descr: >-
          All conversations and supporting documentation can be stored directly
          in relevant cells so that you always know where the data comes from.

        title: NEVER LOSE IMPORTANT INFORMATION
      - descr: >-
          Have all assumptions and numbers in a single place without worrying
          about controlling versions or chasing pieces of information in long
          email threads.

      Mistakes can be costly - this is why it is imperative to ensure that the
      source model is robust and calculations are correct. With Visyond you can
      quickly identify the root causes of errors, [explore cell
      dependencies](/features/dependency-analysis/) and audit the spreadsheet in
      [Audit Mode](/features/audit-mode/).

          When in Audit Mode, Visyond offers simple and intuitive ways to track
          errors and their root cause.

          It highlights error and circular cells clearly; The trendlines help
          you visually identify unexpected behaviors; The Precedents Panel
          displays on top the precedent cells that are error - this way you can
          identify the root cause of the error propagation chain with a few
          clicks.

          Dependency analysis gives you a bird’s eye view of your model in the
          same way Google Maps does of a neighborhood. It’s a powerful auditing
          tool, uncovering errors that would be otherwise painstaking to catch.
