  and without accurate numbers, youâ€™ll draw the wrong conclusion.

    title: Transform the Way You Analyze and Present Data
  - descr: "Visyond is cloud-based (or on-premise) so you _never lose information_ - you can manage and transfer team knowledge easily and _stop being called all the time just to make minor changes_.\n\nBuild and audit your solid model once, have Visyond help identify potential errors and then _securely share_ only relevant cells, charts and analysis _with only those who need to see and interact with them_. \r\n\r\nVisyond _never breaks formulas or loses your team's work_ while always tracking their input and changes.\r\n"

    title: Never Lose Critical Information and Reduce Error Probability
  - descr: "Our built-in analysis tools _automate typical routine tasks_ (like scenario creation and comparison, identification of the most important model drivers) that would otherwise require expensive software, add-ons, writing macros or error-prone lengthy manual setups. \r\n\r\nWith Visyond you will need just a few clicks and minutes to _perform analyses that used to take days_.\r\n"

    title: Save Time and Enhance Your Analysis and Reports
  - descr: >-
      Every cell in Visyond can store _multiple coexisting inputs_, attachments
      and conversations. You can add different cases (i.e. optimistic &
      pessimistic forecasts) to any cells and combine them into as many
      scenarios as you like and then quickly _compare them on-the fly_.


      Then, with the help of powerful interactive dashboards, you can _securely
      share_ the results with stakeholders _allowing them to test their own
      assumptions directly in the dashboards_ without the risk of breaking the
      underlying model and calculations.

      The process took 1 stressful week and I did not feel comfortable to update
      the data, fearing to break something. Now it is a 1-hour job and a few
      clicks to update data.
