      Make smarter decisions faster by getting valuable insights with
      **Visyond’s interactive dashboards that don’t require long manual setups
      or programming and act as a separate sandbox environment linked to your
      model**. 


      They enable you and your collaborators to play with selected important
      assumptions without interacting with the spreadsheet directly. Input
      fields (i.e. sliders, drop-down lists, etc.) are placed on the
      presentations and update the output cells or charts in real-time without
      changing what is in the spreadsheet.

      Visyond interactive slides also let you **easily build various apps, such
      as ROI calculators, Sales quotation calculators and many more that can be
      shared with your colleagues, clients or embedded on a webpage with the
      data being supplied from your spreadsheet**.


      The process is simple and does not require wiring a line of code or
      unmaintainable macro.

      With Visyond’s granular permission control and secure selective sharing
      you can **expose only parts of the model and presentations slides that you
      deem necessary with only specific stakeholders**. 


      Do you want your clients or colleagues to understand how different
      scenarios affect the outcome but don’t want them to accidentally break the
      calculations you’ve been working on or see unnecessary details in a
      crowded spreadsheet?


      With Visyond it is simple - in few clicks generate the scenarios, put them
      on a Visyond slides with selected input / output cells and charts, and
      share just this slide with the client.
