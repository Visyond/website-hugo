topSubTitle: >-
  As a decision maker with demanding priorities, your time is too limited to
  collect reports from every corner within your organization and then piecemeal
  each report into building the picture. That can be mind numbing – especially
  when your company’s future is at stake.

      Visyond’s built-in analysis tools automate typical routine tasks that
      would otherwise require expensive software, add-ons or error-prone lengthy
      manual setups. For example, build a downloadable Analytics report with
      just one click.

      * Add cases to any cell and combine them in scenarios.

      * Have as many scenarios as you like without creating the chaos of
      multiple files and model versions.

      * Visualize and compare all the scenarios with just a few clicks.

      * Every cell in Visyond is multi-dimensional and like a database.
