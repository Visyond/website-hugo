  - descr: "When you need secure and transparent collaboration, traditional spreadsheets require additional manual processes. It usually means passing data via email or other mechanisms and then possibly combining the information together. This opens the door for loss time and working with inaccurate data. Most businesses protect themselves by conducting several manual audits. This only leads to more loss time, while other departments wait for your reports – and no one needs that!\r\n\nWith Visyond, test assumptions, consolidate data, run analysis at an unprecedented speed and accuracy. Visyond is cloud-based so you never lose information, you can manage and transfer team knowledge easily (no more spreadsheets kept on someone’s desktop), and eliminate dependency from the model creator by testing your assumptions from any device without risking to break the model.\r\n\nIt’s been designed to never break formulae or lose your teams’ work, tracking their input and changes.\r\n"
