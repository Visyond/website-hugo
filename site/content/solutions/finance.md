    title: Eliminate Dependency on the Modeler
  - descr: >-
      Visyond makes data gathering & consolidation easier by helping you avoid
      common issues that arise when collecting inputs. You no longer need to
      create multiple spreadsheet templates, manually distribute it among
      stakeholders risking accidental layout and formula changes and spending
      long hours auditing the spreadsheets once you’ve received them back with
      data.

          You can share only specific cells you want stakeholders to contribute
          data to by simply selecting the cells and inviting collaborators to
          edit them.

          Every time you invite a contributor (e.g., a colleague in a department
          or subsidiary), Visyond creates a clone of the worksheet with a name
          you assign.

          It highlights error and circular cells clearly; The trendlines help
          you visually identify unexpected behaviors; The Precedents Panel
          displays on top the precedent cells that are error - this way you can
          identify the root cause of the error propagation chain with a few
          clicks.

          Visyond allows you to use human-readable names that immediately reveal
          the modeler’s logic without you having to chase precedent cryptic
          cells (i.e., what is B7? and G41?), especially when they are on
          different worksheets.
