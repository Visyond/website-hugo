  - descr: "Traditional spreadsheets require lots of additional manual processes like passing data via email and manual data consolidations. This opens the door to a massive loss of time and high risk of working with inaccurate data. Most business employ additional manual audits to protect themselves which leads to even more time lost while other departments wait for your reports!\r\n\r\nWith Visyond you can _easily consolidate data, test assumptions, run analysis at an unprecedented speed and accuracy_.
