      Full control over who can view or edit what parts of the spreadsheets -
      manage permissions down to individual cell level. It allows stakeholders
      only to interact with selected reports and present with interactive slides
      where they can test their assumptions without breaking any of the
      carefully crafted formulas.

    title: SECURE SELECTIVE SHARING
  - descr: >-
      Each cell can store multiple inputs from different people allowing you to
      effectively work together without the risk of overriding data or
      calculations, worrying about tracking down changes in the endless
      back-and-forth emails containing different versions of the same document.

  - descr: >-
      In Visyond, the spreadsheet is the central repository for all relevant
      information such as supporting files, discussions, comments and approval
      status allowing you to have a knowledge management system integrated in
      your spreadsheet.

  - descr: >-
      All inputs are self-documented giving you a full audit trail showing you
      who changed what and when. You can always go back to previous versions of
      the spreadsheet and compare them on the fly, or revert any changes
      individually, without rolling back the entire document.

      Businesses and individuals around the still rely on Excel & PowerPoint to
      cover their spreadsheet and presentation needs. That is why we built an
      import and export functionality that can handle even the most complex
      spreadsheets and let you easily export slides & dashboards you’ve created
      in Visyond.
