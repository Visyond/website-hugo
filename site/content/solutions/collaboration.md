      Full control over who can view or edit what parts of the spreadsheets -
      **manage permissions down to individual cell level**. It allows
      stakeholders only to interact with selected reports and present with
      interactive slides where they can **test assumptions** without breaking
      any of the carefully crafted formulas.

      Each **cell can store multiple inputs** from different people allowing you
      to effectively work together without the risk of overriding data or
      calculations, worrying about tracking down changes in the endless
      back-and-forth emails containing different versions of the same document.

      In Visyond, the **spreadsheet is the central repository for all relevant
      information** such as supporting files, discussions, comments and approval
      status allowing you to have a knowledge management system integrated in
      your spreadsheet.

      All inputs are self-documented giving you a **full audit trail** showing
      you who changed what and when. You can always go back to previous versions
      of the spreadsheet and compare them on the fly, or **revert any changes
      individually**, without rolling back the entire document.
