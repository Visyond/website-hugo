  dashboards in a collaborative planning and forecasting solution with an always
  up-to-date spreadsheet at the center.
WhyVisyondText: "* Visyond transforms decision-making into a truly collaborative experience by removing the need to use multiple tools and transfer data between them.\r\n* Modelers, analysts, decision makers and clients can securely collaborate and have accessible and easy-to-use automation tools in a single, cloud-based decision-making platform with the spreadsheet model at the center, without version chaos and risks of losing information or overwriting data.\r\n* Insights can be communicated through interactive dashboards that are managed in a single place, and seen only by specific stakeholders, without the need to update static slides at every assumption change.\r\n* Stakeholders can stress-test the assumptions in a safe environment where they are the only one seeing the output driven by their changes and where they cannot accidentally break the underlying model."

          Unlike other spreadsheets, multiple assumptions can coexist in a cell
          as opposed to last value overwriting the existing one. Nobody,
