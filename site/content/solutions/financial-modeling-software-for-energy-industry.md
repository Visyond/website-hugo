    descr: "Have experts fill shared worksheets with their data, and use the data to update any predictive model you have. Data-entry people will only see their specific data entry worksheets and add supporting documents and comments directly inside the relevant cells. You do not need to save support documents on different platforms or try to remember where something is or who provided certain assumptions.\r\n<br><br>\r\nUnlike other spreadsheets, multiple assumptions can coexist in a cell as opposed to last value overwriting the existing one, and nobody, including the project owner, can modify data entered by others.\r\n"

Distribute interactive presentations to investors or stakeholders, which they can use to ask the spreadsheet ‘what-if’ questions using sliders and dropdowns without actually touching or seeing the spreadsheet.\r\n<br><br>\r\nChanging data on the slides does not make changes to the spreadsheet, so you don’t have to worry about losing important information or introducing architectural changes to the model.\r"
