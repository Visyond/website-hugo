          <strong>You never lose information.</strong> Multiple assumptions
          can coexist in the same cell. The last added value does not
          overwrite the existing ones. Nobody, including the project owner,
          can modify data entered by others.
      - answer: >-
          <strong>You easily manage scenarios.</strong> Create and compare
          scenarios on-the-fly with just a few clicks during meetings or
          presentations, and quickly identify which business drivers change
          between scenarios.
