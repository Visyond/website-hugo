      - answer: >-
          <strong>You never lose information.</strong> Multiple assumptions
          can coexist in the same cell. The last added value does not
          overwrite the existing ones. Nobody, including the project owner,
          can modify data entered by others.
      - answer: >-
          <strong>You easily manage scenarios.</strong> Create and compare
          scenarios on-the-fly with just a few clicks during meetings or
          presentations, and quickly identify which business drivers change
          between scenarios.
      - answer: >-
          <strong>You decide who sees and interacts with specific worksheets
          and dashboards.</strong> Share only specific worksheets, reports
          and dashboards with specific people for better control over
          information flow and data privacy.
      - answer: >-
          <strong>You connect decision makers, consultants, analysts,
          modelers, and other stakeholders together in a single secure
          environment.</strong> Out of the box, every member of the team has
          access to automated tools that help them do their job faster,
          while minimizing the risk of accidental errors.
