      You can share only specific cells you want stakeholders to contribute data
      to by simply selecting the cells and inviting collaborators to edit them.
      Every time you invite a contributor (e.g., a colleague in a department or
      subsidiary), Visyond creates a clone of the worksheet with a name you
      assign.

      Once contributors have completed the data entry, you can consolidate
      information with one click - Visyond will create a consolidated worksheet
