  Visyond’s Interactive Slides are an elegant way to present data from your
  spreadsheets - information is always up to date, as each slide automatically
  syncs data with your spreadsheet. Interactive elements such as input fields
  and charts allow stakeholders to test their own assumptions through a safe and
  simple user interface.

      You can **share the whole presentation or just a few individual slides**
      with selected stakeholders using Visyond’s unique [Selective
      Sharing](https://visyond.com/features/selective-sharing/) feature without
      exposing the spreadsheet and any sensitive or unnecessary information.
      Stakeholders can then safely test their own assumptions without breaking
      or ever seeing the model and calculations.


      And, of course, you can always export the presentation to Powerpoint.

          Allow stakeholders to see only individual parts or whole presentations
          that they can use to test their own assumptions without interacting
          with the spreadsheet directly.
