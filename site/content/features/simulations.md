          If you do not know what probability distribution is more appropriate
          for a certain input, click on the button What Distribution for my
          Data? and paste you historical data. Visyond will show you the
          cumulative distribution function of the historical dataset and the
          major theoretical distributions, so you can visually decide what is
          the best fit.
