  Charts are the cornerstone of a good presentation and an irreplaceable
  analysis tool. In Visyond, charting is simple, fast and does not require
  learning complex menus - charts are automatically updated, even if the chart
  is in Visyond’s [Interactive
  Presentations](https://visyond.com/features/interactive-presentations/).
