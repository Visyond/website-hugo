      With Visyond’s Selective Sharing you can **share only specific parts of
      spreadsheets**, down to a single cell, without exposing any other data,
      conversations, attachments or calculations. With this, data gathering and
      consolidation is much faster and less prone to errors and accidental
      updates.
