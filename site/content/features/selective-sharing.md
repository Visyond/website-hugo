  Visyond allows you to communicate more efficiently while avoiding data leaks.
  It removes the need for emailing spreadsheets, back-and-forth copy-paste
  between PowerPoint and Excel or any other visualization tool. Instead, you can
  share only specific areas of the spreadsheet, whole presentations or just
  individual slides. You always know who has access to what so you can avoid
  unauthorized access and unwanted spreadsheet updates.

      You can share the whole project, certain worksheets or only specific parts
      of a worksheet, whole presentations or specific slides without exposing
      any other data, conversations, attachments or calculations. With this,
      data gathering and consolidation is much faster, safer and less prone to
      errors and accidental updates.
