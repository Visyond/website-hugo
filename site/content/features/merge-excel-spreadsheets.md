topTitle: Structured Spreadsheet Data Gathering and Consolidation
WhyVisyondText: >-
  Easily gather & consolidate data and merge spreadsheets - you no longer need
  to create multiple spreadsheet templates, manually distribute it among
  stakeholders risking accidental layout and formula changes and spending long
  hours auditing the spreadsheets once you’ve received them back with data.
