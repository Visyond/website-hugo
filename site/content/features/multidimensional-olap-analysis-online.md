      Visyond combines models and their outputs directly with OLAP tables and
      charts, allowing for flexible, on-the-fly multidimensional analysis:


      * Structure your worksheet to have consistent structures (e.g., each
      worksheet is the operating model or P&L of a business unit) and have your
      finance cube automatically built

      * Easily apply custom calculations and transformations to your reports

      * Customize structure by adding rows, columns and dimensions in real time
      without long data preparation, processing and exports to other platforms
