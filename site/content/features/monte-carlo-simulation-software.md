      Simulation analysis is a powerful forecasting tool applicable to almost
      every field - from Finance and Sales to Engineering:


      * Generate descriptive statistics, probability density function and
      cumulative distribution function

      * Manage uncertainty and risk and make forecasts quickly

      * Easily identify what probability distribution is more appropriate for
      your data

          Monte Carlo Simulation Software - Visyond Will Help You Find
          Probability Distribution for Your Data
        descr: >-
          If you do not know what probability distribution is more appropriate
          for a certain input, click on the button 'What Distribution for my
          Data?' and paste you historical data. Visyond will show you the
          cumulative distribution function of the historical dataset and the
          major theoretical distributions, so you can visually decide what is
          the best fit.
