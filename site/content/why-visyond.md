  ### Visyond is the only integrated solution enabling collaboration, security
  and automation at every step of modeling, analysis and presentation for
  decision making


  * **Collaborators view or edit only selected elements** through interactive
  web interfaces that hide complexity, unnecessary details and sensitive data.
  All becomes simple and secure. **Nobody can overwrite others’ work**


  * **Single source of truth** is established: history & impact of changes,
  alternative input versions & scenarios, sensitivities, simulations, comments,
  supporting documents **in one place that tells a story**


  * **Analyses, calculators, dashboards and reports are dynamically driven by
  spreadsheets**, built and shared in minutes without experts or moving data
  across tools. **No more lengthy processes and programmers**


  * **Reduce error risk** with real time 'What-if', Financial Statements, KPIs,
  Pivot Tables and Cubes
