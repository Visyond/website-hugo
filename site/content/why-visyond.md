  ### Visyond Enables Collaboration, Security and Automation at <br /> Every
  Step of Modeling, Analysis & Presentation for Decision Making


  Collaborators **view or edit only selected parts of projects** <br /> without
  being exposed to unnecessary details or sensitive information.


  <br /> **Single source of truth** is established by tracking inputs, history
  of changes, scenarios, sensitivities, simulations, <br /> conversations, and
  supporting documentation in a single place that tells a story where **nobody
  can overwrite other’s work.**


  <br /> Analyses, presentations and  calculators, dashboards and reports are
  dynamically driven by spreadsheets,  <br /> **built and shared in minutes  
  without experts or moving data across tools.**


  <br /> **Risk of errors is reduced** with on-the-fly ‘What-If’ analysis,
  Financial Statements, KPIs, Pivot Tables and Cubes.
