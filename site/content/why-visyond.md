  Competitors (spreadsheets, add-ons, slides, forecasting & visualization tools,
  cube/pivot analytics, governance platforms, etc.) **tackle problems
  separately, forcing workarounds with inevitable data chaos, inaccuracy and
  leakage.


  With Visyond, collaborators **view or edit only selected elements** through
  interactive web interfaces that hide complexity, unnecessary details and
  sensitive data. **All becomes simple and secure. Nobody can overwrite others’
  work.**


  <br />


  With Visyond, **single source of truth is established**: history & impact of
  changes, alternative input versions & scenarios, sensitivities, simulations,
  comments, supporting documents in one place that tells a story.


  <br />


  With Visyond, analyses, calculators, dashboards and reports are **dynamically
  driven** by spreadsheets, built and shared in minutes without experts or
  moving data across tools. **No more lengthy processes and programmers**.
  Reduce error risk. Real time what-if, financial statements, KPIs, Pivot tables
  and Cubes.
