  ### Visyond Enables Collaboration, Security and Automation at <br /> Every Step of Modeling, Analysis & Presentation for Decision Making


  Collaborators **view or edit only selected parts of projects**
  <br />
  without being exposed to unnecessary details or sensitive information.


  <br />
  **Single source of truth** is established by tracking inputs, history of changes, scenarios, sensitivities, simulations,
  <br />
  conversations, and supporting documentation in a single place that tells a story where **nobody can overwrite other’s work.**


  <br />
  Analyses, presentations and  calculators, dashboards and reports are dynamically driven by spreadsheets, 
  <br />
  **built and shared in minutes   without experts or moving data across tools.**


  <br />
  **Risk of errors is reduced** with on-the-fly ‘What-If’ analysis, Financial Statements, KPIs, Pivot Tables and Cubes
