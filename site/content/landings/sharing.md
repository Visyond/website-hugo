videoTitle: Sharing and collaborating on traditional spreadsheets can be a mess.
videoDescr: >-
  Once a spreadsheet is sent - you have no control over who can access or modify
  it.


  * Back & forth emails with bits of information or changes attached 

  * Hours lost in tracking down changes and comparing different versions of the
  same file

  * Critical data accidentally deleted or lost along the way, often unnoticed 

  * Confidential and sensitive information leaked or exposed to unintended
  parties

  * As a result: millions of dollars lost due spreadsheet errors, litigation
  risks, reputational damage...


  **Visyond offers a secure, simple and modern way to share and work on
  spreadsheets together.**

    title: Seamless collaboration without endless back & forth emails
  - descr: >-
      In Visyond, your spreadsheet is the central repository for all relevant
      information: supporting files, discussions, comments, and approval status,
      so you can keep track of your important data in one place.
    featureImg: /img/illusrtation 3-2.png
    title: Reduce data chaos by keeping all relevant information in a single place
  - descr: >-
      No one can accidentally change inputs, delete or change formulas or
      assumptions. All changes and steps are self-documented, and the audit
      trail is kept for ever.
    featureImg: /img/illusrtation 2-2.png
    title: Providing accountability & version control

      You no longer have to manually gather inputs from multiple sources. All
      related discussions, comments, and supporting information are stored in a
      single place.
