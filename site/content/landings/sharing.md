features:
  - descr: >-
      In Visyond, each cell is a database that stores multiple inputs from
      different people, attachments and cases. Information about who changed
      what and when is always available for you to view.
    featureImg: /img/illusrtation 1-2.png
    title: Tracking simultaneous inputs from multiple people
  - descr: >-
      You no longer have to manually gather inputs from multiple sources. All
      related discussions, comments, and supporting information are stored in a
      single place.
    featureImg: /img/illusrtation 3-2.png
    title: Enabling seamless sharing & collaboration
  - descr: >-
      No one can accidentally change inputs, delete or change formulas or
      assumptions. All changes and steps are self-documented, and the audit
      trail is kept for ever.
    featureImg: /img/illusrtation 2-2.png
    title: Providing accountability & version control
  - descr: >-
      Have full control over who has access to what at granular level. Manage
      permissions and restrictions like seeing only certain cells, worksheets,
      or reports.
