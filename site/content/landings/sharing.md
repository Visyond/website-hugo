features:
  - descr: >-
      In Visyond, each cell is a database that stores multiple inputs from
      different people, comments and even file attachments. Information about
      who changed what and when is always available for you to view.
    featureImg: /img/illusrtation 1-2.png
    title: 'Tracking everything inside the cell, enable full accountability'
  - descr: >-
      All related discussions, comments, supporting information, and attachments
      are stored inside the cell.
    featureImg: /img/illusrtation 3-2.png
    title: Seamless collaboration
  - descr: >-
      No one can change your input, accidentally delete or change your formula
      or assumption. All changes and steps are self-documented, and the audit
      trail is kept for ever.
    featureImg: /img/illusrtation 2-2.png
    title: 'Full version control, no need for storing multiple files'
  - descr: >-
      Have full control over who has access to what at granular level. Manage
      permissions and restrictions like seeing only certain cells, worksheets,
      or reports.
