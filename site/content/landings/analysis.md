  When it comes to financial analysis, organizations using traditional
  spreadsheets encounter many obstacles such as difficulty identifying key
  variables that have the most impact, clearly understanding the underlying
  logic behind complex financial models to make sense of the output, or making
  sure that every possible scenario coming from multiple sources is properly
  accounted for. With Visyond, you don't have to worry about this anymore.
