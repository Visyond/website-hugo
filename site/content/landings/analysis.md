  When it comes to financial analysis, organizations using traditional
  spreadsheets encounter many obstacles such as difficulty identifying key
  variables that have the most impact, clearly understanding the underlying
  logic behind complex financial models, or making sure that every possible
  scenario coming from multiple sources are properly accounted for. An accurate
  financial analysis is the cornerstone of every business, small or large, local
  or international. You need accurate forecasts. Every input and output could
  give your organisation an advantage over the competition.
