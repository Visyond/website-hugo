      You no longer need to juggle dozens of slightly different versions of the
      same spreadsheet. Keep everything in the same spreadsheet with the ability
      to roll-back at any time.

      In Visyond, each cell is a database that stores multiple inputs from
      different people, comments and even file attachments. Everyone who needs
      to contribute can input their numbers through an easy to manage a
      collaborative process. Information about who changed what and when is
      always available for you to view.
  - btn: 'Import & Export spreadsheets, link external sources'
    descr: >-
      Easily import data from the existing spreadsheets into Visyond and
      continue working without interruptions. Export the spreadsheet to share
      with someone outside the platform. All values and formulae will be safely
      carried over to the new document. Add an external spreadsheet & reference
      any cells from it directly in Visyond.
  - btn: 'Cloud-based: access from anywhere, on any device'
    descr: >-
      Your data will always be available to you wherever you are in the world,
