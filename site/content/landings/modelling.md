videoDescr: >-
  Financial modelling is a labour intensive and painstaking process that
  requires enormous precision from those responsible and leaves no room for
  errors. It is not optimal to rely on traditional spreadsheets for modelling as
  they fall flat in many areas such as identifying dependencies between elements
  of the model, managing complex unreadable formulas all while fighting not
  quite intuitive interfaces and trying to make sense of different versions of
  spreadsheets flying around. Our intelligent platform, Visyond, solves this.

      Detailed analysis usually involved multiple scenario inputs, many of which
      will come from business decision makers. Visyond makes gathering data from
      numerous sources easy to manage, keeping everything in one spreadsheet.
      Now you can compare different scenarios and cases side-by-side without
      having to dig through different versions of spreadsheets.
