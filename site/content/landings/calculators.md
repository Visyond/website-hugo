videoDescr: >-
  Explaining the value of a project or purchase is relatively easy.
  Demonstrating value, in figures, in a spreadsheet and presentation, is not
  easy as it often involves numerous complex calculations. Whether you are doing
  a cost/benefit analysis or simple ROI calculation, this can involve hours or
  days of work. Either you need customised software or an Excel expert to make
  sense of the figures and formula to turn this data into something you can show
  to stakeholders or a potential client. Visyond offers a better way!
