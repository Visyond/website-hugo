title: Enhanced Spreadsheet Governance and Control

videoTitle: It is time to take your spreadsheets under control!
videoDescr: >-
  Traditional spreadsheets cannot handle dynamic and fluid information flow and
  effectively manage organization of data.  As a consequence, human errors are
  inevitably introduced. Hours and days are lost in attempts to track down
  changes and compare different versions of the same document.  New regulations
  and data protection rules also create additional pressure and scrutiny
  requiring organizations to transform and adapt their workflows. Visyond
  eradicates all these obstacles!

  - descr: >-
      In Visyond, each cell is a database that stores multiple inputs from
      different people, comments and even file attachments. Information about
      who changed what and when is always available for you to view.
    featureImg: /img/illusrtation 1-2.png
    title: 'Tracking everything inside the cell, enable full accountability'
  - descr: >-
      No one can change your input, accidentally delete or change your formula
      or assumption. All changes and steps are self-documented, and the audit
      trail is kept for ever.
    featureImg: /img/illusrtation 2-2.png
    title: 'Full version control, no need for storing multiple files'
  - descr: >-
      Have full control over who has access to what at granular level. Manage
      permissions and restrictions like seeing only certain cells, worksheets,
      or reports.
