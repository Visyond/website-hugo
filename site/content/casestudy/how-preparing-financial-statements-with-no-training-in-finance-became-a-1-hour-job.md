  Armando is the Founder and CEO of **eLearnSecurity**, a Silicon Valley company
  providing cyber security training to IT Security professionals worldwide.


  As a CEO, Armando understands his business drivers very well, but he needed
  help to translate his operating model into financial statements to share with
  banks and investors, and to make strategic decisions.


  Financial statements (i.e., Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cash Flow
  Statement) are fundamental for many company-related activities, including
  company valuation, stock options allocation and other activities that require
  a common language with finance people.


  > The process took 1 stressful week and I did not feel comfortable to update
  the data, fearing to break something. Now it is a 1-hour job and a few clicks
  to update data.

  [**Analysts and
  Consultants**](https://visyond.com/solutions_analysts_consultants)


  As an analyst or consultant, you either revamp existing systems or invent new
  ones. Constantly, you identify areas that need improving. But your first step
  begins with the deep analysis, before researching for the optimum solution.
  Without accurate numbers, you’ll draw the wrong conclusion – and no career
  needs the downfall from that!

  [**Decision Makers**](https://visyond.com/solutions_roles_decision-makers)


  As a decision maker with demanding priorities, your time is too limited to
  collect reports from every corner within your organization and then piecemeal
  each report into building the picture. That can be mind numbing – especially
  when your company’s future is at stake.

  [**Data Input &
  Consolidation**](https://visyond.com/solutions_data-entry-consolidation)


  Every month-end or end of quarter it’s a never-ending hassle gathering and
  consolidating financial information across departments. Finance develops new
  spreadsheet templates – hopefully error-free! And then they begin to pass
  spreadsheets among departments to gather the numbers. This often wastes time,
  and requires added work to verify and recheck the data’s accuracy. And during
  the process the reasons behind each modified number often loses its visibility
  – causing further inquiries. This all makes closing your books ceaseless
  nightmare.

## Before Visyond

Armando has been looking for a solution for a long time but could not find a suitable tool.

* His current accounting system didn’t allow him to forecast beyond the coming the year. This meant he had to maintain his forecast in Excel and prepare his financial statements manually – requiring extra work.
* Typically his staff needed an extra week to analyze the formulas and verify each spreadsheet entry for proper categorizing (e.g. CAPEX and OPEX) for accuracy. The statements needed to balance properly. And if an item needed recategorizing (e.g. from CAPEX to OPEX), this meant redoing most of the work – exponentially expanding the time to complete the task.

> The remarkable thing in Visyond is that if I have a lot of cost items, I don’t need to worry where to type them: I can decide later what is an OPEX or a CAPEX by selecting and deselecting them from intuitive screens.

## After Visyond

Armando had a lot of data in Excel and other ERPs so the way for him to benefit immediately from Visyond was by importing his Excel files.

With Visyond, _“I simply started to categorize the items in my model following an intuitive step-by-step dialogue. The statements were ‘magically’ populated. This saved me a huge amount of time and mental sanity!”._
