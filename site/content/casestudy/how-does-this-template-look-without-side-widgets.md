  Hello and welcome to the test page! Your are not really supposed to be here

  present. It will be gone very soon so do not worry! :)

# Before Visyond

It was not very good, there were a lot of problems and the tools and methods used could not improve the situation.

# After Visyond

Visyond helped improve a lot of modeling and communication processes and simplify workflows. What took days to accomplish is now a 5-minutes job. Success!
