  [**Analysts and
  Consultants**](https://visyond.com/solutions_analysts_consultants)


  As an analyst or consultant, you either revamp existing systems or invent new
  ones. Constantly, you identify areas that need improving. But your first step
  begins with the deep analysis, before researching for the optimum solution.
  Without accurate numbers, you’ll draw the wrong conclusion – and no career
  needs the downfall from that!

  [**Decision Makers**](https://visyond.com/solutions_roles_decision-makers)


  As a decision maker with demanding priorities, your time is too limited to
  collect reports from every corner within your organization and then piecemeal
  each report into building the picture. That can be mind numbing – especially
  when your company’s future is at stake.

  [**Data Input &
  Consolidation**](https://visyond.com/solutions_data-entry-consolidation)


  Gathering Every month-end or end of quarter it’s a never-ending hassle
  gathering and consolidating financial information across departments. Finance
  develops new spreadsheet templates – hopefully error-free! And then they begin
  to pass spreadsheets among departments to gather the numbers. This often
  wastes time, and requires added work to verify and recheck the data’s
  accuracy. And during the process the reasons behind each modified number often
  loses its visibility – causing further inquiries. This all makes closing your
  books ceaseless nightmare.

## Before Visyond

This is how Fernando's job look like:

* He had to collect inputs by meeting or calling each colleague individually
* Even written contributions were “tricky”: colleagues were saving their inputs on their own copies of the plan and the reconciliation was a daunting task
* Every three months he had to prepare a new set of spreadsheets and to create several sets of different hypothesis/scenarios, each time rerunning the numbers
* Finally, at each round there were specific requests from senior management which led to the preparation of customised reports and charts

> Visyond’s automated tools are saving me a lot of time. It took me days to stress test my forecasts and it now takes me a few clicks. This also gives me peace of mind that nothing will be forgotten or broken accidentally.

## After Visyond

After Visyond was implemented, Fernando’s job changed completely. Thanks to Visyond’s “Cases” and “Scenarios” tools, he can now share the master file between the stakeholders to collect their inputs without the fear they could alter or damage the core structure - and subsequently prepare different scenarios acting on each parameter without changing the spreadsheets set.

Also, preparing reports, charts, and forecasts for senior management has become easy and quick.
