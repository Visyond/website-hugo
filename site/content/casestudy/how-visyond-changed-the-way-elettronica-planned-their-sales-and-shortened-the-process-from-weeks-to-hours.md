  - content: >-
      **Challenge**


      * Current spreadsheet-based Sales planning was time-intensive and
      impractical

      * Needed an easy-to-use interface for scenario planning

      * Needed an online and user-friendly platform

      * Collect assumptions without sending email attachments

      * Track collaborators’ assumptions

      * Save backup information and files inside the relevant cells

      * Quickly switch scenarios

      * Run simulations on the assumptions

      * Generate and present results and reports automatically

      **Solution**


      * Single, cloud-based Territory & Quota data model

      * Visyond Replaced multiple copies of the spreadsheets sent and
      consolidated manually with Visyond dynamic cases and scenarios managed

      * Visyond introduced real-time collaboration to the existing workflow and
      made the process much faster

      * Transparency and accountability for data input Results at a Glance

      **Result at the glance**


      * Process completed in hours instead of the typical few days with
      Excel-based process: at least 20 times faster

      * Clarity for every stakeholder about different versions of data and
      impact of their assumptions

      * Separate paperwork and notes have been eliminated thanks to auto
      reporting

      * Ability to create different versions of data and compare scenarios in
      real-time

      * Simplicity and quick turnaround for 'what-if' assumption changes

> It was a very time consuming process with a high risk of mistakes at each step, due to the manual implementation and the large set of inputs.

## Before Visyond

This is how Fernando's job look like:

* He had to collect inputs by meeting or calling each colleague individually
* Even written contributions were “tricky”: colleagues were saving their inputs on their own copies of the plan and the reconciliation was a daunting task
* Every three months he had to prepare a new set of spreadsheets and to create several sets of different hypothesis/scenarios, each time rerunning the numbers
* Finally, at each round there were specific requests from senior management which led to the preparation of customised reports and charts

> Visyond’s automated tools are saving me a lot of time. It took me days to stress test my forecasts and it now takes me a few clicks. This also gives me peace of mind that nothing will be forgotten or broken accidentally.

## After Visyond

Thanks to Visyond’s “Scenarios”, he now shares only one file with his stakeholders and collects their input without fearing they could alter or damage the model structure. Everything is transparently tracked.

Preparing reports, charts, and forecasts for senior management is now an automated, easy and quick process.
