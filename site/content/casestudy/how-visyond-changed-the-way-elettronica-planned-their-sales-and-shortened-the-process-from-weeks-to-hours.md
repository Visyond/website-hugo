      **Use Cases**

      * Sales Planning

      **Challenge**


      * Current spreadsheet-based Sales planning was time-intensive and
      impractical

      * Needed an easy-to-use interface for scenario planning

      * Needed a platform, online and user-friendly to:

      * Collect assumptions without sending email attachments

      * Track collaborators’ assumptions

      * Save backup information and files inside the relevant cells

      * Quickly switch scenarios

      * Run simulations on the assumptions

      * Generate and present results and reports automatically

  - content: "Result at the glance\r\n\n* Process completed in hours instead of the typical few days with Excel-based process: at least 20 times faster\r\n* Clarity for every stakeholder about different versions of data and impact of their assumptions\r\n* Separate paperwork and notes have been eliminated thanks to auto reporting\r\n* Ability to create different versions of data and compare scenarios in real-time\r\n* Simplicity and speed in changing assumptions and and presenting the new results"

### Before Visyond

This is how Fernando's job look like:

* He had to collect inputs by meeting or calling each colleague individually
* Even written contributions were “tricky”: colleagues were saving their inputs on their own copies of the plan and the reconciliation was a daunting task
* Every three months he had to prepare a new set of spreadsheets and to create several sets of different hypothesis/scenarios, each time rerunning the numbers
* Finally, at each round there were specific requests from senior management which led to the preparation of customised reports and charts

> Visyond’s automated tools are saving me a lot of time. It took me days to stress test my forecasts and it now takes me a few clicks. This also gives me peace of mind that nothing will be forgotten or broken accidentally.



### After Visyond

After Visyond was implemented, Fernando’s job changed completely. Thanks to Visyond’s “Cases” and “Scenarios” tools, he can now share the master file between the stakeholders to collect their inputs without the fear they could alter or damage the core structure - and subsequently prepare different scenarios acting on each parameter without changing the spreadsheets set.

Also, preparing reports, charts, and forecasts for senior management has become easy and quick.
