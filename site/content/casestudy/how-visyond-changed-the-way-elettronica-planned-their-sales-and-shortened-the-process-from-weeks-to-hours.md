      **Challenge**


      * Current spreadsheet-based Sales planning was time-intensive and
      impractical

      * Needed an easy-to-use interface for scenario planning

      * Needed a platform, online and user-friendly to:

      * Collect assumptions without sending email attachments

      * Track collaboratorsâ€™ assumptions

      * Save backup information and files inside the relevant cells

      * Quickly switch scenarios

      * Run simulations on the assumptions

      * Generate and present results and reports automatically
