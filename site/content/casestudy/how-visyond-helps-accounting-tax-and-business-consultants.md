client_ask: "Financial and business consultancy is a multi-layered and sophisticated endeavor that demands a great degree of accuracy and responsibility across all business activities.\r\n\nThe surface, or ‘client-facing’, layer has to have definitive answers to the challenges of **handling of sensitive information**, **management of clients’ expectations**, and **continuous communication** process with the clients among others.\r\n\nAs even the fastest sports car in the world cannot reach its top speed if the engine is not carefully calibrated, consulting businesses cannot reach their full potential and effectiveness in communicating the value that their insights bring on the table if a company’s ‘inner layers workings' are not finely-tuned and efficient.\r\n"

## Before Visyond

There are many challenges in daily routine operations of a consultant:

* Communications with clients go through **multiple unrelated channels of communication that are hard to monitor and manage** and involve many unnecessary steps resulting in lots of time wasted on chasing information and back-and-forth emails.
* As a consequence of inefficient communication methods, **consolidation of data turns into a very painstaking task.**
* The resulting data chaos often leads to **information being accidentally lost, leaked** or accessed without proper authorization.
* **Reporting and presentations of data have to be done quickly**, be accurate and easy to understand for the client who may not be as 'financially proficient' as the advising side.
* Sometimes, in the middle of report, dashboard or presentation preparation or even after the it has been forwarded to a client, **the changes to underlying source data** force consultants not only to restart the report preparation but also the 'communication labyrinth-workflow' resulting in many man-hours lost...
* ...and then a need arises to do a **comparison of previous report's scenarios with the new report's scenarios** which creates a lot of backtracking for all involved parties trying to identify what value for which indicator must go in which version of a report.
* If a client needs to 'play with the numbers' themselves they **risk accidentally breaking the carefully crafted model and calculations** and potentially getting false insights even if they are cautious and know what they are doing. 
* **Performing scenario analysis and answering what-if questions** requires spending time on writing macros and debugging them instead of analyzing and comparing the data. In addition, the introduction of new variables requires constant updates and maintenance of macros.

## After Visyond

* Visyond acts as a repository for all the information: raw data, calculations and relations between data, versions, comments, attachments, and approval. Having a **single source of truth** dramatically reduces time spent on communication and data consolidation.
* With the help of Visyond's **role-based permission system** and **Selective Sharing** that allows to limit access down to individual cells or just a single slide, the risk of data leaks is greatly mitigated.
* Different **cases and scenarios co-exist** in a single document and can be switched at any time without breaking the model or any calculations.
* It takes **just a few minutes to complete Scenario Analysis**, and it can be updated easily on-the-fly.
* Sharing the results of analysis has never been so simple - Visyond's **easy-to-use interactive slides & dashboards** not only **allow sharing of only specific bits of information** but also **let clients test their assumptions**, answer 'what-if' questions and 'play with the numbers' directly on these slides without compromising or breaking the underlying model.
