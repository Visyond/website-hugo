    title: Results
study_intro: >-
  The analyst from a leading telecommunications provider was tasked with creating monthly dashboards for the CEO, and faced the challenge of aggregating data from various departments, including HR, Operations, Sales, and more.


  The data was stored in different systems, mainly NetSuite and Excel, making it challenging to produce accurate and up-to-date reports.


  With Visyond, the analyst was able to quickly produce accurate and timely reports that aggregate data from different sources and don’t require manual data entry or copy-pasting data and charts between Excel and PowerPoint. 


  Visyond’s interactive dashboards and scenarios allowed the analyst to create various versions of the same report with different data (January data, February data, etc.), making it easy for the CEO to access the information and compare data from different periods. 


  Overall, using Visyond to create ‘time-traveling’ reports helped the analyst and their team to improve the quality and accuracy of the reports while saving time and effort.
